```

spark-defaults.conf

spark.eventLog.enabled    true(by default)

spark.eventLog.dir        hdfs:///user/spark/eventlog

# Set spark executor memory

spark.executor.memory     2g

spark.logConf             true

logs would be dumping at hdfs:///user/spark/eventlog

make it true and set the location, you will find the logs then

```
