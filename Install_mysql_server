Install MySQL server. From a terminal window, type:

For RHEL/CentOS:

yum install mysql-server

Start the instance.

/etc/init.d/mysqld start

Set the root user password.

mysqladmin -u root -p‘{password}’ password $mysqlpassword

Remove unnecessary information from log and STDOUT.

mysqladmin -u root 2>&1 >/dev/null

As root, use mysql (or other client tool) to create the “dbuser” and grant it adequate privileges. This user provides access to the Hive metastore.

CREATE USER '$dbusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$dbuserpassword';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbuser'@'localhost';

CREATE USER 'dbuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'dbuserpassword';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbuser'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

See if you can connect to the database as that user. You are prompted to enter the $dbuserpassword password above.

mysql -u dbuser -p $dbuserpassword

Install the MySQL connector JAR file.

For RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux:

yum install mysql-connector-java*

For SLES:

zypper install mysql-connector-java*

For Ubuntu:

apt-get install mysql-connector-java*
